## [0.8.0] - 2023-09-05

### Added

- Add option to delete file(s) from server (#54)

`rustpaste` now supports deleting files starting from [`0.14.0`](https://github.com/orhun/rustypaste/releases/tag/v0.14.0) thus a new flag (`-d`) is added to `rpaste`.

```sh
rpaste -d file.txt
```

To use this feature, set tokens for both `rustypaste` and `rustypaste-cli` in the configuration file via `delete_tokens` / `delete_token` option.

### Changed

- Use IsTerminal from stdlib (#55)
- Disable Rust beta builds
- Upgrade dependencies

## [0.7.0] - 2023-08-12

### Added

- Added `-l` flag for retrieving file list from the server (#45)

For example:

```sh
rpaste -l  # JSON output
rpaste -lp # Table output (pretty)
```

`[server].expose_list` option should be set to `true` on `rustypaste` server for this flag to work.

### Removed

- Remove extra newline from version output (#36)

## [0.6.0] - 2023-07-08

### Changed

- Automatically detect if the data is piped (#28)

Now when data is piped into `rpaste`, there is no reason to add `-` as a file.

Before:

```
cat whatever.txt | rpaste -
```

After:

```
cat whatever.txt | rpaste
```

- Upgrade dependencies
